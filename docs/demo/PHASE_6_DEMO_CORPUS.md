# Phase 6 demo corpus

## Purpose

The Phase 6 demo loader seeds a **small, API-created** dataset so the GraphClerk UI can be exercised against **real backend rows** (no frontend mocks).

## Files

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `demo/phase6_demo_corpus.md` | Markdown ingested via `POST /artifacts` |
| `scripts/load_phase6_demo.py` | HTTP client loader |

## Run

From the **repository root**. Point the script at the same URL as your API (Docker default host port is **8010**):

```bash
# Windows PowerShell example:
$env:GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8010"

python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py --dry-run
python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py
```

```bash
# Unix example:
export GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8010
python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py --dry-run
python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py
```

If `GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL` is unset, the script falls back to **`http://localhost:8000`** — override when using the default **8010** Compose mapping (see root **`README.md`**).

The alternate env name **`GRAPHCLE_API_BASE_URL`** is accepted only if `GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL` is unset (legacy typo tolerance in the script — prefer **`GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL`**).

## Metadata tagging

Where the public API allows `metadata` on the request body, the loader sets:

```json
{
  "demo_corpus": "phase_6",
  "created_by": "demo_loader"
}
```

**Artifact:** `POST /artifacts` inline JSON schema does **not** expose artifact `metadata`; the loader uses a clear filename/title instead (`phase6_demo_corpus.md`). Evidence units created during ingestion inherit whatever the backend stores today — there is no separate “demo” flag on EvidenceUnits via this loader.

## Reruns

Each run creates **new** artifacts, nodes, edges, links, and semantic indexes (UUIDs always fresh). **Nothing is deleted.** Repeated runs **duplicate** demo-shaped rows unless you clean the database manually.

Timestamps are embedded in some labels to make rows easier to spot in the UI.

## Semantic index / vector search (honest limitation)

`POST /semantic-indexes` creates rows with `vector_status` typically **`pending`** until a separate vector-indexing path runs (not invoked by this loader).

Therefore:

- **`GET /semantic-indexes/search`** may return **no** hits for the demo index until it is **indexed** in your deployment’s vector backend.
- **`POST /retrieve`** may not route through the demo semantic index the way a fully indexed deployment would; behavior follows the File Clerk when indexes are not **`indexed`**.

This loader **does not** write to the database directly and **does not** fake indexing through hidden APIs.

## Manual vector indexing (rich demo — Track B Slice B1)

After the demo loader creates a semantic index, `vector_status` is usually **`pending`**. To move it to **`indexed`** (or explicit **`failed`**) using the **same** Postgres + Qdrant the API uses:

1. From the loader output or **Semantic indexes** UI, copy the new semantic index **UUID**.
2. Set **`DATABASE_URL`** and **`QDRANT_URL`** to match the running API (same values as the `api` container / `backend` `.env`).
3. From the **repository root** (with `qdrant-client` and backend deps installed):

   ```bash
   python scripts/backfill_semantic_indexes.py --semantic-index-id "<UUID>"
   ```

   Or process pending rows in batch (see `python scripts/backfill_semantic_indexes.py --help`).

The script uses **`DeterministicFakeEmbeddingAdapter`** (8 dimensions) for embeddings — **dev/test only**, not a semantic production model. It **does not** auto-run on `POST /semantic-indexes` create. If `embedding_text` is missing or whitespace-only, the row becomes **`failed`** with `metadata.graphclerk_vector_indexing` explaining why (no fake **`indexed`**).

### Qdrant collection `semantic_indexes` — vector dimension mismatch (dev)

If backfill or indexing **fails at upsert** with errors that suggest **vector size / dimension mismatch** (for example Qdrant rejected the point because the collection was created with a **different** vector size than **8**):

1. **Cause:** Qdrant’s **`semantic_indexes`** collection is fixed to the size it was **created** with. The repo’s deterministic dev path uses **dimension 8**. An older or experimental collection (e.g. size **3**) will reject **8**-dimensional vectors. This is **not** automatic backfill and **not** production embedding behavior — see [`docs/governance/TESTING_RULES.md`](../governance/TESTING_RULES.md) → *Qdrant `semantic_indexes` vector dimension mismatch*.
2. **Dev-only fix:** On **local/disposable** Qdrant only, delete **only** the **`semantic_indexes`** collection, then rerun backfill so the collection is **recreated** at size **8**. Do **not** do this against production data without approval.
3. **Afterward:** Retry indexing for rows stuck in **`failed`** if needed (`--semantic-index-id` or `--all-pending` per script help).

## Manual end-to-end smoke path

Use this path to verify **control plane + UI + retrieval logging** with the Phase 6 demo. There is **no** `POST /answer`, **no** answer synthesis step, **no** OCR/ASR/video pipeline on this path, and **no** claim of production model inference — only public APIs and the script-only loader.

**Truth baseline**

- The demo loader is **script-only** (see `scripts/load_phase6_demo.py`). It creates **new** rows each run: artifact, evidence units, graph nodes/edges/links, and a semantic index row — all via HTTP.
- **`vector_status`** on the created semantic index may stay **`pending`** until a separate indexing/backfill path runs.
- **`GET /semantic-indexes/search`** returns only **`vector_status=indexed`** rows; pending indexes do not appear in search results.
- **`POST /retrieve`** can still return a **schema-valid** `RetrievalPacket` with **empty** `evidence_units` and honest **warnings** (for example when no indexed semantic route matches). That outcome is **coherent**, not automatically a bug.
- **`RetrievalLog`**: when logging succeeds, the UI’s **Retrieval logs** tab should still show an entry with the stored packet snapshot even if evidence is empty.
- The UI can inspect **Artifacts & evidence**, **Graph explorer**, **Semantic indexes**, **Query playground**, and **Retrieval logs** — all against **live** APIs (no bundled mock corpus).

**Steps**

1. **Start Docker / API** — from repo root, e.g. `docker compose up -d --build` and confirm the API is reachable (default host port **8010**; see root `README.md`).
2. **Run loader dry-run** — set `GRAPHCLERK_API_BASE_URL` to match the API (e.g. `http://localhost:8010`), then `python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py --dry-run`. Confirm the printed HTTP plan looks correct.
3. **Run loader** — `python scripts/load_phase6_demo.py` (no `--dry-run`). Confirm success (new artifact, graph, semantic index created each run).
4. **Open UI** — run the Vite dev server from `frontend/` (`npm run dev`) or your preview setup; ensure the UI targets the same API (proxy / `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
5. **Inspect Artifacts & evidence** — confirm the new markdown artifact and at least one evidence unit appear.
6. **Inspect Graph** — confirm demo nodes, edge, and node–evidence link are visible in **Graph explorer**.
7. **Inspect Semantic indexes** — open the new index; note **`vector_status`** (often **`pending`** after a stock loader run). Use search only if you expect **indexed** rows; pending rows will not surface in **`GET /semantic-indexes/search`**.
8. **Query playground** — submit a question grounded in the ingested text, for example: *“What is the retrieval trace hook in the Phase 6 demo corpus?”* or *“What checklist items does the demo markdown mention?”* Inspect the returned **RetrievalPacket** (readable sections + raw JSON): intent, warnings, `evidence_units`, optional Phase 7 context fields.
9. **Retrieval logs** — open **Retrieval logs**; confirm a log row exists for the retrieve when logging succeeds, and that you can open the stored packet even if evidence was empty.
10. **Interpret empty evidence** — if **`vector_status`** is still **`pending`**, empty or sparse evidence from **`POST /retrieve`** is expected for the current File Clerk design (vector route over **indexed** indexes only). Do not treat that alone as a failed smoke unless you intended a **rich** demo (see below).
11. **Confirm no `/answer` step** — there is no endpoint or UI tab that performs **`POST /answer`** or LLM answer synthesis; the trace ends at the packet and logs.

## Minimal vs rich demo

**Minimal demo (default expectation after script load)**

- **Proves:** ingest and row visibility; graph and semantic index **rows** exist; **`POST /retrieve`** returns a valid packet; **RetrievalLog** / UI can show the packet; warnings and empty evidence are interpretable.
- **Does not require:** non-empty semantic vector search hits or filled **`evidence_units`** from the demo semantic index while **`vector_status`** is **`pending`**.

**Rich demo (optional “evidence-filled” tier)**

- **Requires:** at least one semantic index with **`vector_status=indexed`**. Use the **manual backfill** script above (or your own operator flow calling `SemanticIndexVectorIndexingService`) after `load_phase6_demo.py`; the loader still **does not** index vectors itself.
- **Then:** `GET /semantic-indexes/search` and File Clerk route selection can attach traversal and you may see **non-empty** `evidence_units` when the question aligns with indexed meaning.

For release-style verification, record whether your run was **minimal** (empty evidence acceptable with pending indexes) or **rich** (indexed vectors present).

### Policy decision (Phase 0–8 completion — C5)

**Chosen policy: option C**

- **Minimal E2E** (loader + UI + retrieve + logs; **`vector_status`** often **`pending`**; evidence may be empty) is **accepted as sufficient** for Phase **0–8** closure and for **Phase 9 planning** — no requirement to implement automatic backfill first.
- **External or stakeholder demos** that must show **semantic-route evidence snippets** need a **dev-only “indexed” setup** (for example opt-in integration flows with Qdrant + embedding upsert, or other operator-documented steps — **not** added to `load_phase6_demo.py` by this policy) **or** an explicit walkthrough that **pending** indexes mean search and File Clerk semantic routing only consider **`indexed`** rows.
- **Automatic** vector indexing on create / background jobs remain **out of scope** for this policy; **manual** backfill (`scripts/backfill_semantic_indexes.py`) is available for dev/rich demos (Track B Slice B1).
